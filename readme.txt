Reservation System
This program allows its users to discover new places(restaurants, pubs, clubs, ...) 
to go and provide a quick and easy process to make reservation. It includes information 
about places like address, phone number and left comments with popularity rates by other
users. Users can see the menu, price list and order of tables which are determined and 
uploaded by owner of these places during their reservation process. Moreover, program includes 
a navigation system that can detect the users' place and show them near places around them. 
Also, it can navigate them where they want to go.

Current Status : nearly %70 of our project is finished.
